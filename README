The goal of the project is to provide an extension to OW2 Chameleon Rose (http://chameleon.ow2.org) to manage REST Resources using Sun Jersey. This allows to get OSGi services exposed as REST resources.

The idea is to 'annotate' services which will be detected by Rose. Then, Rose delegates the exposition to the Jersey exposer (this project), which manages the communication with Jersey.

The result will be close to the Spring-Jersey bridge but for iPOJO and OSGi services.
